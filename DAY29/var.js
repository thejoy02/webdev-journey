ðŸŸ¢ Variables, Objects, Data Types
What will be the output of typeof null?

Create an object car with brand, model, and year. Print model.

Whatâ€™s the difference between let, const, and var?

How do you check if a variable is an array?

Create a nested object and access a deep property.

1.null output would be object from default
`2.`
let car = {
    brand: `Grand Vitara`,
    model: `Delta`,
    year: 2025
}

console.log (car["model"])
console.log (car.model)

`3.`
Difference b/w let const and var is - let is block scoped varibale i.e its value can be named only once in global and a particular scope ; whereas var is global level variable , and changes its value everytime assigned. const value can't be changed.

`4.`

let a = [1,2,3];

console.log(Array.isArray(a));

let car = {
    brand: `Grand Vitara`,
    model: `Delta`,
    year: 2025,
    choice: {
        color1 :"white",
        color2 :"grey",
        color3 :"black",
    }
}

console.log(car.choice.color2)
Object.entries(car.choice).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
});
// for (let key in car.choice) {
//     console.log (`${key}: ${car.choice[key]}`);
// }
